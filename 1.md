# Module 1 - Introduction
## Learning objectives
* Define cloud computing
* Describe the essential characteristics of cloud computing
* Briefly recount the history and evolution of cloud computing
* Describe the key considerations that organizations can use as a guide while creating their cloud strategy
* Describe the key cloud service providers and their services
* Create an account on a public cloud platform

## Definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing
* Cloud computing: delivery of on-demand computing
* NIST: US National Institute of Standards and Technology
* Defn: a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources with minimal management effort or service provider interation.
### Examples:
1. Networks
2. Servers
3. Storage
4. Applications
5. Services
### Cloud model:
* 5 Essential characteristics:
  * On-demand self-service: you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interace, without requiring human interaction with each service provider
  * Broad Network Access: cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tables, laptops, and workstations
  * Resource Pooling: what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient. Resources dynamically assigned based on demand.
  * Rapid elasticity: you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don't.
  * Measured service: you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.
* 3 Deployment models:
  * Public: leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
  * Private: the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for excludive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.
  * Hybrid: mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly
* 3 Service models (3 layers in a computing stack): 
  * Infrastructure: IaaS - You get access to infrastructure an physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the need to manage or operate them
  * Platform: PaaS - you get access to the platform, that is the hardware and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet
  * Application: SaaS - is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand software"
