## Definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing
* Cloud computing: delivery of on-demand computing
* NIST: US National Institute of Standards and Technology
* Defn: a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources with minimal management effort or service provider interation.
### Examples:
1. Networks
2. Servers
3. Storage
4. Applications
5. Services
### Cloud model:
* 5 Essential characteristics:
  * On-demand self-service: you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interace, without requiring human interaction with each service provider
  * Broad Network Access: cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tables, laptops, and workstations
  * Resource Pooling: what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient. Resources dynamically assigned based on demand.
  * Rapid elasticity: you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don't.
  * Measured service: you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.
* 3 Deployment models:
  * Public: leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
  * Private: the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for excludive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.
  * Hybrid: mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly
* 3 Service models (3 layers in a computing stack): 
  * Infrastructure: IaaS - You get access to infrastructure an physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the need to manage or operate them
  * Platform: PaaS - you get access to the platform, that is the hardware and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet
  * Application: SaaS - is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand software"

## History and evolution of cloud computing
### Cloud Computing Ecolution
* 1950: Large-scale mainframes w/ high volume processing power.
  * The practice of time sharing, or resource pooling, evolved.
  * Multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power
* 1970s: VM- virtual machine
  * Mainfranes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines, on a single physical node
### Virtual Machines
* VMs -multiple distinct compute environments on the same physical hardware
* Each virtual machine hosted fuest operating systems that behaved as though they had their own memory, CPU, and hard drives, even though these were shared resources

### Virtualization
* A huge catalyst for evolutions in computing
* Shared hosting environments
* Virtual private servers
* Virtual dedicated servers

### Cloud: switch from CapEx to OpEx
* Capital Expense (High up-front costs)
* Operating Expense (No or low up-front costs): Pay-as-you-go
* Scale their workloads during usage peaks, and scale down when usage subsided

## Key considerations for Cloud Computing
### Key drivers for moving to cloud
* Agility
* Competitiveness
* Flexibility

### Intrastructure and Workloads
* The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical
* Low initial costs and pay-as-you-go-attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant cost savings

### SaaS and development platforms
* Leasing or buying?
* Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shelf software and subsequently investing in upgrades

### Speed and Productivity
* Organizations also need to consider what it means for them to get a new application up and running in 'x' hours on hte cloud versus a couple of weeks, even months on traditional platforms
* Also, the person-hour cost efficiencies increases from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics, and active analytics

### Risk Exposure
* Hardware and software or rent by the hour
* Organizations need to consider the impact of making a wrong decision -their risk exposure
* Is is safer for an organization to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the code if they're uncertain about adoption?
* And is it better for them to "try" something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

### Benefites of cloud adoption
* Flexibility
  * Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs
  * customize applicaitons
  * access cloud services from anywhere
  * Helps keep data secure
  * Virtual private clouds
  * enryption
  * API keys
* Efficiency
  * Enterprise users can get applications to market without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or its maintenance
  * Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device
  * Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups
* Strategic Value
  * The most innoovative technologies

### Challenges of cloud adoptions
* Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
* Governance and sovereignty issues
* Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
* Lack of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interpolate
* Choosing the right deployment and service models to serve specific needs
* Pertnering with the right cloud service providers
* Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery

## Module 1 Summary:
● Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

● The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

● Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

● Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure
