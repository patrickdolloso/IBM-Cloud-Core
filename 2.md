# Module 2: Cloud Adoption and Emerging Technologies
## Introduction
* In this module, you will learn about the business case for cloud adoption and case studies that demonstrate the results achieved by organizations through cloud adoption. You will also learn about some of the emerging technologies being supported by cloud computing.
### Learning Objectives
* Describe the business case for cloud adoption and case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting cloud
* Explain how emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Analytics are being accelerated by the Cloud

## Artificial Intelligence on the Cloud
* Cloud provides scalable on-demand resources
* IoT behaviour based on AI responses
* AI acts on data from IoT devices

## Blockchain & Cloud
* Blockchain: a secure, immutable network that allows members to view only the transactions that are relevant to them
* 85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT needs
* More than 70% of businesses use more than 3 clouds
* Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies. Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies. This is the mutually beneficial, three-way relationship between Blockchain, AI, and Cloud.
