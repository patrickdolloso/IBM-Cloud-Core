# Module 3: Cloud Computing Services and Deployment Models
## Learning Objectives
* Describe the features, benefits, and use cases for the 3 main cloud service models - IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
* Describe the features, benefits, and use cases for the 3 cloud deplouyment models -Public, Private, and Hybrid

## Overview of service models
* IaaS Infrastructure
  * IaaS could provider manages
  * Data centers
  * Cooling
  * Power
  * Networking & security
  * Servers & storage
* PaaS Platform
  * PaaS cloud provider manages the platform infrastructure
  * OS
  * Dev tools
  * Databases
  * Business Analytics
* SaaS Application
  * SaaS Cloud provider hosts & manages
  * Applications
  * Data

## IaaS Infrastructure as a service
* Is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental:
* compute
* network
* storage
* to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis
* the cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises fata center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer

## IaaS cloud
* the ability to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery
* A: Physical data centers
* B: Compute: 
* C: Network
* D: Storage

1. Test and development: enable their teams to set up test and development environments faster. Helping developmets focus more on business logic than infrastructure management
2. Business continuity & disaster recovery: require a significant amount of technology and staff investments. Make applications and data accessible as usual during a disaster/outage
3. Faster deployments and scaling: to deploy their web applications faster.
4. Highe performance computing: to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations
5. Big Data Analytics: Patters, trends, and associations requires a huge amount of processing power. Provides the required high-performance computing but also makes it economically viable

## PaaS Platform as a Service
* A cloud computing model that provides a complete application platform to
  * develop
  * deploy
  * run
  * manage

### PaaS providers host & manage:
* Servers
* Networks
* Storage
* OS
* Application runtimes
* APIs
* Middleware
* Databases

### Essential characteristics of PaaS
* High level of abstraction: eliminate complexity of deploying applications
* Support services and APIs: simplify the job of developers
* Run-time environments: executes code according to application owner and cloud provider policies
* Rapid deployment mechanisms: deploy, run, and scale applications efficiently
* Middleware capabilities: support a range of application infrastructure capabilities

### Use Cases
* API Development and management
* IoT
* BA/Intelligence
* Business process management (BPM)
* Master data management (MDM)

### Advantages of PaaS
* Scalability
* Faster time to market
* Greater Agility and innovation

### PaaS available offerings
* AWS Elastic beanstalk
* cloud foundry
* IBM cloud paks
* Azure
* Openshift
* Magneto
* Force.com
* Apache stratos

### Risks of PaaS
* Information security threats
* Dependency on service provider's infrastructure
* Customers lack control over changes in strategy, service offerings, or tools

### SaaS - Software as a Service
* A cloud offering that provides access to a service provider's cloud-based software
* Providers maintains:
* Servers
* Databases
* Application Code
* Security


## Public Clud
* Deployment models indicate
  * Where the infrastructure resides
  * Who owns and manages it
  * How cloud resources and services are made available to users
* Public cloud:
  * Servers
  * Storage
  * Network
  * Security
  * Applications
* Using web consonles and APIs, users can provision the resources and services they need
* The cloud provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the infrastructure
* Users don't own the servers their applicatins run on or storage their data consumes, or manage the operations of the servers, or even determine how the platforms are maintained
*
