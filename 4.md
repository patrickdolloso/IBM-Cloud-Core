#  Components of Cloud Computing
## Introduction
* In this module, you will learn about the various components of a cloud computing architecture, such as virtualization, virtual machines, bare metal servers, and the difference between virtual machines and bare metal servers. You will learn how to build a secure cloud networking presence and how container-based technologies work.
### Learning Objectives
* Describe the key components of cloud infrastructure
* Explain virtualization
* List the features and benefits of virtual machines
* List the features and benefits of bare metal servers and how they differ from virtual servers
* Describe how to build a secure cloud networking presence
* Explain how contain-based technology works

## Overview of Cloud Infrastructure
* After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type offered by vendors, customers need to plan the infrastructure achetecture. The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud
* Region: is a geographic area or location where a cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East
### Availability zones
* Multiple avalability zones
* Have their own power, cooling, networking resources
* Isolation of zones improves the cloud's fault tolerance, decreases latency
* Very high bandwidth connectivity with other AZs, Data Centers and the internet

### Computing resources
* Cloud providers offer several compute options - Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and "Serverless" computing resources
